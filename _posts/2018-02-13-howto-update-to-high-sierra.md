title: Howto update to macOS High Sierra

_Hint: this is NO HowTo, just a rant!_

* __the night before__ download the 5 GB file to save time during the day
* __8:00__ do this important thing that needs to be done on the Mac, maybe the update will take a bit longer
* __8:30__ click on _update to High Sierra_
* __8:35__ ok, lets do this other thing from the ToDo-list I can do on any other PC
* __10:00__ lets see what this High Sierra looks like
* __10:05__ hmm, the update is still not finished, just the loading screen with a loading bar and the apple
* __10:10__ ok, there are certainly some other things on the ToDo-list that can be done without the Mac
* __12:30__ still the loading bar, but nearly full. Time for lunch.
* __13:00__ still the loading bar, lets see what other people say what to do when the update is stuck: _"Hit Ctrl+L"_ to see the log. OK, lets try this --> nothing happens, but when I come back the loading bar is around 70% - __great!__
* what do other people say? [_"if you leave it for a few hours it could finally get to the end of its task" .. "Sometimes updates can take 16 hours or more"_](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-fix-mac-that-wont-finish-macos-update-3624050/) - great news! What else is on my ToDo-list?
* __15:30__ still no progress, time to go outside
* __18:30__ back home, still no progress ... WTF
* __18:35__ time to bring the big guns in: longpress Power-Button to power off .. wait few seconds and power on again ... the loading bar at 70% again .. lets do something else
* __18:45__ come back and there is the High Sierra Login Screen .... finally
* __18:50__ start writing this rant
