# GitHub Overview

This page shall give an overview of [my activities on Github](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Aznegva&type=Issues) and short explanations about my public projects.

## resources-generator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/znegva/resources-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/znegva/resources-generator)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/znegva/resources-generator/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/znegva/resources-generator)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/resources-generator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/resources-generator)

The key reason to start this project was that I couldn't find a suitable tool for creating graphics for a Cordova project that could exactly meet all my requirements.
It should be easy to configure and support the creation of NinePatch images for the Android platform.

Currently you can use it either via command line or within your own scripts.
If you use it in your own scripts, you are free to choose the exact specifications you want to use for the creation.
As a first starting point you can use the typical specifications for icons and splashscreen of the Android and iOS platforms, which are also included.

[gm](http://aheckmann.github.io/gm/) and [imageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) are used for image creation.

Later, with the help of this project, I decided to become familiar with other tools as well.
To try out the release of the script itself via npm, continuous integration via Travis CI and the release of code coverage data via Codecov.
